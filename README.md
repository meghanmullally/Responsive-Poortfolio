## Updates 

This portfolio will be updated when I have more projects to showcase to my future employers. 

- New Update: May 27, 2019: made modifications to the style.css in order to have a responsive portfolio on tablets, cellphones and laptops. By adding @media it will allow viewers to experience a smoother and more responsive website. 

- New update: May 28, 2019: Modifications to media screen 640 -- portfolio is now in a column vs a row. This makes it easier to see rather than having them all bundled up next to each other. The header , navbar and logo name are now on parrell to one another vs next to each other.
