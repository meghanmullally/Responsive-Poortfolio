## Updates 

This portfolio will be updated when I have more projects to showcase to my future employers. 

- New Update: May 27, 2019: made modifications to the style.css in order to have a responsive portfolio on tablets, cellphones and laptops. By adding @media it will allow viewers to experience a smoother and more responsive website.
