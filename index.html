        Hi, my name is Meghan! I'm 24 years old, I graduated from Washington State University with a bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems, in 2018.

      <p>
        I was born and raised in Seattle, WA. A few of my hobbies are traveling, playing tennis and golf, hiking, reading manga and listneing to music. I also enjoy playing with my dog and spending time with my family. 
      </p>

        I want to become a web developer, because in middle school and high school I had a tumblr. I would always mess around with the HTML but I never knew how to make full templates. I wasn't sure how to find the right resources to teach me at the time. I love seeing the outcome of a project and making the pages aesthically pleasing.
